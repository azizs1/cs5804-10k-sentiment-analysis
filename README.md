<h3 style="text-align:center;">How can we utilize sentiment analysis on annually filed 10-K reports to predict market performance for the subsequent fiscal year?</h3>

## Background Information
Annually, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandates that companies file a 10-K report detailing their financial statements for the year, as well as risk factors the company is concerned about for the previous and coming year. It also includes a discussion of the companyâ€™s performance for the prior year, which can give an idea of what the company expects for the next fiscal year.

## Objectives
The project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model to evaluate the content of 10-K filings and assess its impact on market performance for certain publicly traded companies. This project leverages NLP techniques to investigate the relationship between sentiment scores and financial indicators like trading volume and stock volatility. Analyzing certain sections of 10-K reports would aid in capturing market response due to certain corporate actions such as regulatory changes or lawsuits.
